# Clauses
Clauses are elements which contain a subject, which is the focus of the clause, and a predicate, which details an action that is completed by the subject. A clause can be either independent or dependent.

## Independent Clauses
Independent clauses are clauses that express a complete thought and are capable of standing on their own as a sentence. While typically quite lengthy, it is possible to create 2-word independent clauses as long as there is a subject and a predicate:
> We ate.

When using implied subjects, independent clauses can even be just a single word:
> Run!

## Dependent Clauses
Like independent clauses, dependent clauses contain a subject and a predicate. However, unlike independent clauses, dependent clauses do not complete a thought and therefore cannot create a sentence on their own. Instead, dependent clauses rely on an independent clause in order to form a sentence. For example:
> Once you have enough money.

The adverbial clause does not complete a thought; it requires an independent clause.

There are three types of dependent clauses: noun, relative, and adverbial. Each dependent clause has its own specific grammatical function.
