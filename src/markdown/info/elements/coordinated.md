# Coordinated Elements
Most grammatical elements can be coordinated with other grammatically similar elements using a coordinator. Once coordinated all of the elements function as a single element.

## Similar, yet different
In order for elements to be coordinated with one another, they have to function in a grammatically similar fashion. This does not mean, however, that the elements in question must all be *exactly* the same.

> Both *he* and *his dog* are walking in the park.

*He* is a pronoun and *his dog* is a noun phrase. They are coordinated together to form the noun phrase *both he and his dog*.
