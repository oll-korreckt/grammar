## Properties
<!-- +propertySummary -->

### Head
> I came here *to eat* food.

### Phrasal
Certain phrasal verbs are created by combining a verb with a preposition phrase. The phrasal property can be used to signify such verbs.

> The company plans to deal *with the dwindling sales* by launching a new advertising campaign.
<!-- .caption -->
When combined with the preposition phrase *with the dwindling sales*, the infinitive *to deal* becomes a phrasal verb since it alters the semantic meaning of *to deal*. Thus, the preposition phrase *with the dwindling sales* belongs in the **phrasal** property.

> The plane rose to fly *over the mountain*.
<!-- .caption -->
Combining *over the mountain* with the infinitive *to fly* does not modify the semantic meaning of *to fly*. The preposition phrase *over the mountain* therefore belongs in the **modifier** property.

### Modifiers
Modifiers can consist of any element that functions adverbially and does not alter the semantic meaning of the infinitive.

> The dog likes to *quickly* eat his food.
<!-- .caption -->
*Quickly* is an adverb that modifies *to eat*.

> I always try to play *to win*.
<!-- .caption -->
The infinitive *to win* modifies the infinitive *to play*.

> It would be quite expensive to live *in that house*.
<!-- .caption -->
The preposition phrase *in that house* modifies *to live*. It does not, however, alter its semantic meaning and so does not belong under the **Phrasal** property.

### Subject Complement
Despite not being a predicate, infinitive phrase created from linking verbs can still accept a subject complement.

#### Nouns
> His goal is to become *mayor*.
<!-- .caption -->
The noun, *mayor* is the subject complement of the infinitive phrase, *to become mayor*.

#### Adjectives
> They tried to remain *calm*.
<!-- .caption -->
The adjective, *calm* is the subject complement of the infinitive phrase, *to remain calm*.

#### Preposition Phrases
> I want to be *in the room* when the announcement is made.
<!-- .caption -->
The preposition phrase, *in the room* is the subject complement of the infinitive phrase, *to be in the room when the announcement is made*.

### Direct Object
> The countryside is the best place to see *stars*.

### Direct Object Complement
> To elect him *mayor* would be a grave mistake.

### Indirect Object
