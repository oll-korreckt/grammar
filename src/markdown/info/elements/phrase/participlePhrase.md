## Properties
<!-- +propertySummary -->

### Head
> The newly *printed* book weighed over 10 pounds.

### Head Modifier
> The *recently* elected mayor declared a state of emergency.

### Head Compliment
> The lottery ticket thrown *in the trash* turned out to be the winning ticket.

### Subject Compliment
> The dog, seeming *afraid*, left in a hurry.

### Direct Object
> Look for the man wearing *a red hat*.

### Direct Object Compliment (not supported)
As mentioned earlier, participle phrases do not support the use of a direct object complement. Below is an attempt:
> The person appointed her judge was happy when she accepted.

The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains two predicates. In order to make the sentence correct while still keeping the underlying semantic meaning intact would be to use a relative pronoun to introduce a relative clause:
> The person who appointed her judge was happy when she accepted.

### Indirect Object
> Visitors serving *the animals* food will be expelled from the zoo.
