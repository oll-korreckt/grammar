#### Nouns

The noun, *fish* is the subject complement of the participle phrase, *being fish*.

#### Adjectives

The adjective, *afraid* is the subject complement of the participle phrase, *seeming afraid*.

#### Preposition Phrases
> John, feeling *under the weather*, slowly walked to his desk.
<!-- .caption -->
The preposition phrase, *under the weather* is the subject complement of the participle phrase, *feeling under the weather*.

### Direct Object
> Look for the man wearing *a red hat*.

### Direct Object Complement (not supported)
As mentioned earlier, participle phrases do not support the use of a direct object complement. Below is an attempt:
> The person appointed her judge was happy when she accepted.

The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains two predicates. In order to make the sentence correct while still keeping the underlying semantic meaning intact would be to use a relative pronoun to introduce a relative clause:
> The person who appointed her judge was happy when she accepted.

### Indirect Object
> Visitors serving *the animals* food will be expelled from the zoo.
