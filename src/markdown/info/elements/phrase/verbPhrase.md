Verb Phrases can assume many forms due to the number of possible properties they can have. Luckily, most Verb Phrases will only contain a few properties.

### Head
|Required?|Allow Multiple?|Types|
|---|---|---|
|Yes|No|`Verb`|

All verb phrases must be headed by a verb.

### Head Modifier

Optionally, verb phrases can contain head modifiers which modify the head of the phrase. The head modifier should answer one of the following questions:
- when?
- where?
- in what manner?
- for what purpose?

#### Adverbs
> The dog ran *quickly*. (adverb)

> The dog ran *very quickly*. (adverb phrase)

> The dog ran *when he saw a squirell*. (adverbial clause)

#### Nouns
> The dog ran *five miles*.

#### Prepositions
> Look *up*! (preposition)

> The dog ran *across the field*. (preposition phrase)

#### Infintives
One can use infinitives in order to modify the verb. However, it is worth noting that infinitives can also be used as a direct object. Thus, it is important to take great care determine whether an infinitive is being used to modify the main verb or as object of the main verb.

> You should play *to win* and *to learn*. (coordinated infinitive)

> The dog ran *to catch the squirell*. (infinitive phrase)

### Head Compliment
There exist certain verbs that are often referred to as *factitive verbs* which allow for the use of a head compliment. In terms of the number of viable grammatical elements, head compliments are incredibly flexible.

### Subject Compliment
|Required?|Allow Multiple?|Types|
|---|---|---|
|No|No|`Noun`, `Noun Phrase`, `Noun Clause`, `Adjective`, `Adjective Phrase`, `Preposition`, `Preposition Phrase`|

Subject compliments are only used with certain verbs.

#### Nouns
> She is *president*. (noun)

> She is *a skilled heart surgeon*. (noun phrase)

> She is *whom you should be speaking with*. (noun clause)

#### Adjectives
> The cat is *old*.

> The cat is *very old*.

#### Prepositions
> What is *up*?

> They are *outside*.

> Drinks are *on the house*.

### Direct Object
|Required?|Allow Multiple?|Types|
|---|---|---|
|No|No|`Noun`, `Noun Phrase`, `Noun Clause`, `Gerund`, `Gerund Phrase`, `Infinitive`, `Infinitive Phrase`|
|No|No|`Noun`, `Noun Phrase`, `Noun Clause`, `Adjective`, `Adjective Phrase`, `Preposition`, `Preposition Phrase`|

Certain verbs allow for a direct object compliment. Such verbs are sometimes called *factitive verbs*. A direct object complement is similar to a subject compliment.

#### Nouns
> I made him *an honorary member*.

#### Adjective
> We deem it *necessary*.

#### Infinitive
> He was nominated *to head the department*.

### Direct Object Complement
|Required?|Allow Multiple?|Types|
|---|---|---|
|No|No|`Stuff`|

*Factitive verbs* are capable of having a direct object complement. In terms of function and acceptable gramatic elements, direct object complements are quite similar to subject complements.

### Indirect Object
|Required?|Allow Multiple?|Types|
|---|---|---|
|No|No|`Noun`, `Noun Phrase`, `Noun Clause`, `Gerund`, `Gerund Phrase`, `Infinitive`, `Infinitive Phrase`|

Certain verbs, commonly refered to as *ditransitive verbs*, allow for the use of a 2nd object called an *indirect object*. The *indirect object* is the object of the verb which recieves the direct object. Perhaps the most intuitive example that can be offered is with the verb *to give*:
> The man gave *the dog* **a bone**.

*the dog* and **a bone** are both objects of the verb "gave." *the dog* serves as the indirect object whereas **a bone** is the direct object meaning that **a bone** is being acted upon by the verb and *the dog* is the recipient of the indirect object.

#### Nouns
> I made *Bob* a sandwich. (noun)

> We found *the cat* a home. (noun phrase)

> The teacher assigned *whoever failed the test* extra homework. (noun clause)

#### Pronouns
Pronouns are often used as indirect objects. However, keep in mind that they must take the objective case where possible.

> The artist will paint *him and me* a portrait. (coordinated pronoun)

#### Gerunds
> I will give *running* a try. (gerund)

> The coach gave *listening to his players* a chance. (gerund phrase)

#### Infinitives?
