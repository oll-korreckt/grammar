# Verb Phrases

<!-- !verbPhrase -->
In terms of function, Verb Phrases are quite simple as they serve only as the predicate of a Clause.

## Properties
<!-- +propertySummary -->

Verb Phrases can assume many forms due to the number of possible properties they can have. Luckily, most Verb Phrases will only contain a few properties.

<!-- #head -->
### Head
All verb phrases must be headed by a verb.

<!-- #headModifier -->
### Head Modifier
Optionally, verb phrases can contain head modifiers which modify the head of the phrase. The head modifier should answer one of the following questions:
- when?
- where?
- why?
- in what manner?
- to what degree?

Head modifiers are similar to head complements with the distinguishing feature being that head modifiers are not semantically essential whereas head complements are.

#### Adverbs
> The dog ran *quickly*.

Adverb Phrase

<!-- .caption -->
Adverbial Clause

#### Nouns
> The dog ran *five miles*.

#### Preposition Phrases
> The dog ran *across the field*.

#### Infinitives
One can use infinitives in order to modify the verb. However, it is worth noting that infinitives can also be used as a direct object. Thus, it is important to take great care determine whether an infinitive is being used to modify the main verb or as object of the main verb.

> You should play *to win* and *to learn*.

Infinitive Phrase

<!-- #headCompl -->
### Head Complement
Head complements semantically alter a verb. In order to determine whether an element is functioning as a head modifier or a head complement, you can try removing the element from the sentence in order to see if the meaning of the verb is altered. For example, there is a semantic difference between the following sentences:

> Put the car *in the garage*.

> Put the car.

On the other hand,

> *Quickly* put the car in the garage.

> Put the car in the garage.

do not have a difference in semantic meaning.

<!-- #subjCompl -->
### Subject Compliment
Subject compliments are only used with certain verbs.

#### Nouns
> She is *president*.

Noun

> She is *a skilled heart surgeon*.

> She is *whom you should be speaking with*.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Clause

#### Pronouns
> It's *them*.

#### Adjectives
> The cat is *old*.
<!-- .caption -->
Adjective

> The cat is *very old*.
<!-- .caption -->
Adjective Phrase

#### Preposition Phrases
> Drinks are *on the house*.

<!-- #dirObj -->
### Direct Object
Certain verbs allow for a direct object compliment. Such verbs are sometimes called *factitive verbs*. A direct object complement is similar to a subject compliment.

#### Nouns
> I made him *an honorary member*.

#### Adjective
> We deem it *necessary*.

#### Infinitive
> He was nominated *to head the department*.

<!-- #dirObjCompl -->
### Direct Object Complement
*Factitive verbs* are capable of having a direct object complement. In terms of function and acceptable grammatical elements, direct object complements are quite similar to subject complements.

<!-- #indObj -->
### Indirect Object
Certain verbs, commonly referred to as *ditransitive verbs*, allow for the use of a 2nd object called an *indirect object*. The *indirect object* is the object of the verb which receives the direct object. Perhaps the most intuitive example that can be offered is with the verb *to give*:
> The man gave *the dog* **a bone**.
<!-- .caption -->
*The dog* and **a bone** are both objects of the verb "gave." *the dog* serves as the indirect object whereas **a bone** is the direct object meaning that **a bone** is being acted upon by the verb and *the dog* is the recipient of the indirect object.

#### Nouns
> I made *Bob* a sandwich.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun

> We found *the cat* a home.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Phrase

> The teacher assigned *whoever failed the test* extra homework.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Clause

#### Pronouns
Pronouns are often used as indirect objects. However, keep in mind that they must take the objective case where possible.

> The artist will paint *him and me* a portrait.
<!-- .caption -->
Coordinated Pronoun

#### Gerunds
> I will give *running* a try.

> The coach gave *listening to his players* a chance.
