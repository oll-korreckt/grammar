# Verb Phrases
<!-- +elementInfo -->
<!-- !verbPhrase -->
Verb phrases are composed of a head verb along with any modifiers, objects, and complements. Verb phrases function just like verbs are used as the predicate of a [clause](clause).

## Properties
<!-- +propertySummary -->

In terms of properties, verb phrases are quite versatile can assume many forms due to the number of possible properties they can have, but it is primarily the case that most verb phrases will only contain one or two properties in addition to the head verb.

<!-- #head -->
### Head
All verb phrases must be headed by a verb.

<!-- #phrasal -->
### Phrasal
Rather than using a particle, certain phrasal verbs are created via a [preposition phrase](preposition-phrase).

<!-- *verbPhrase.phrasal -->
> The answer will depend *on the circumstances*.
<!-- .caption -->
The preposition phrase *on the circumstances* and the verb *will depend* combine to form the phrasal verb *depend on*.

<!-- #modifiers -->
### Modifiers
Optionally, verb phrases can contain modifiers which modify the head of the phrase. Each modifier should answer one of the following questions:
- when?
- where?
- why?
- in what manner?
- to what degree?

#### Adverbs

#### Nouns
<!-- *verbPhrase.modifiers_noun -->
> The dog ran *five miles*.

#### Preposition Phrases
<!-- *verbPhrase.modifiers_preposition-phrase -->
> The dog ran *across the field*.
<!-- .caption -->
The preposition phrase *across the field* modifies the verb *ran*.

#### Infinitives
One can use infinitives in order to modify the verb. However, it is worth noting that infinitives can also be used as a direct object. Thus, it is important to take great care determine whether an infinitive is being used to modify the main verb or as object of the main verb.

### Subject Compliment
Subject compliments are only used with certain verbs.

#### Nouns
> She is *president*.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun

> She is *a skilled heart surgeon*.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Phrase

> She is *whom you should be speaking with*.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Clause

#### Pronouns
> It's *them*.

#### Adjectives
> The cat is *old*.
<!-- .caption -->
Adjective

> The cat is *very old*.

Adjective Phrase

#### Preposition Phrases
> Drinks are *on the house*.

<!-- #dirObj -->
### Direct Object
Certain verbs allow for a direct object compliment. Such verbs are sometimes called *factitive verbs*. A direct object complement is similar to a subject compliment.

#### Nouns
> I made him *an honorary member*.

#### Adjective
> We deem it *necessary*.

#### Infinitive
> He was nominated *to head the department*.

<!-- #dirObjCompl -->
### Direct Object Complement
*Factitive verbs* are capable of having a direct object complement. In terms of function and acceptable grammatical elements, direct object complements are quite similar to subject complements.

<!-- #indObj -->
### Indirect Object
Certain verbs, commonly referred to as *ditransitive verbs*, allow for the use of a 2nd object called an *indirect object*. The *indirect object* is the object of the verb which receives the direct object. Perhaps the most intuitive example that can be offered is with the verb *to give*:
> The man gave *the dog* **a bone**.
<!-- .caption -->
*The dog* and **a bone** are both objects of the verb "gave." *the dog* serves as the indirect object whereas **a bone** is the direct object meaning that **a bone** is being acted upon by the verb and *the dog* is the recipient of the indirect object.

#### Nouns
> I made *Bob* a sandwich.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun

> We found *the cat* a home.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Phrase

> The teacher assigned *whoever failed the test* extra homework.
<!-- .caption -->
Noun Clause

#### Pronouns
Pronouns are often used as indirect objects. However, keep in mind that they must take the objective case where possible.

> The artist will paint *him and me* a portrait.

#### Gerunds
> I will give *running* a try.
