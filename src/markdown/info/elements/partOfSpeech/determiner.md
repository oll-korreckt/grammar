# Determiners

<!-- !determiner -->
Determiners are quite similar to adjectives in that they are used to provide information about a noun. There are, however, a few key differences between the two:
#### Determiners cannot be used as complements.
For example, one can say:
> She is *funny*.

but not:

> She is *the*.

#### A noun can only be described by an infinite number of adjectives but only a single determiner.
> Clifford is a *big, red* dog.
