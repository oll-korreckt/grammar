## Usage

### Introducing Adverbial Clause

Subordinators are frequently used to form adverbial clauses. For example:

<!-- *subordinator.adverbial-clause_because -->
> I went to the game *because* I wanted to see it in person.
<!-- .caption -->
*Because* is used to introduce the adverbial clause *because I wanted to see it in person* which modifies the verb *went*.

<!-- *subordinator.adverbial-clause_as-though -->
> My grandfather gambles *as though* he has nothing to lose.
<!-- .caption -->
*As though* introduces the adverbial clause *as though he has nothing to lose* which modifies the verb *gambles*.

### Introducing Noun Clauses
Noun clauses are typically introduced via a [pronoun](/element/pronoun), but subordinators can also be used for such a purpose.

<!-- *subordinator.noun-clause_after -->
> My favorite time to do my homework is *after* I have eaten dinner.
<!-- .caption -->
*After* introduces the noun clause *after I have eaten dinner* which functions as a subject complement.

<!-- *subordinator.noun-clause_that -->
> *That* you managed to succeed in spite of so many obstacles will inspire many people for years to come.
<!-- .caption -->
*That* introduces the noun clause *that you managed to succeed in spite of so many obstacles* which functions as the subject of the sentence.
