## Properties

## Identification
Though typically composed of a single word, multi-word nouns are possible.

### Single Word
> He is a *good* dog.

> The *ugly* duckling.

### Multi Word
Multi-word adjectives are often derived from words which typically function as nouns.

> She spoke with a *New York* accent.

### Nouns as adjectives
Sometimes, words that are traditionally considered to be nouns can be used as adjectives as long as they are used to describe a noun-like element. For example:

> Dr. Smith is a cardiologist. In other words, he is a *heart* doctor.

### Location
When searching for adjectives, the first places one ought to look are the locations within a sentence directly preceding noun-like elements.

> The *little* cat likes to eat *fresh* salmon.

Another location within sentences where adjectives are likely to reside is within the predicate as either a subject complement or a direct object complement.

> We are *lazy*.
<!-- .caption -->
Here, *lazy* is an adjective being used as a subject complement as it describes the subject **we**.

> I find him *insuferable*.
<!-- .caption -->
*Insuferable* is being used in this circumstance to describe the direct object **him**.

The English language contains numerous terms derived from French which thusly utilize the French rule for adjective placement with the adjective immediately following the noun-like element that it modifies.

> He was the youngest person ever to serve as attorney *general*.
<!-- .caption -->
The adjective *general* modifies the noun **attorney** despite coming after it.
