## Identification
Though typically composed of a single word, multi-word adjectives are possible.

### Single Word
<!-- *adjective.identification_single-word -->
> He is a *good* dog.

### Multi Word
Multi-word adjectives are often derived from words which typically function as nouns.

<!-- *adjective.identification_multi-word -->
> She spoke with a *New York* accent.
<!-- .caption -->
*New York* modifies the noun *accent* and thus functions as an adjective.

### Location
When searching for adjectives, the first places one ought to look are the locations within a sentence directly preceding noun-like elements.

<!-- *adjective.identification_location1 -->
> The *little* cat likes to eat *fresh* salmon.
<!-- .caption -->
Both *little* and *fresh* are located in front of the nouns which they modify.

Another location within sentences where adjectives are likely to reside is within the predicate as either a subject complement or a direct object complement.

<!-- *adjective.identification_location2 -->
> We are *lazy*.
<!-- .caption -->
Here, *lazy* is an adjective being used as a subject complement as it describes the subject *we*.

<!-- *adjective.identification_location3 -->
> I find him *insufferable*.
<!-- .caption -->
*Insufferable* is being used in this circumstance to describe the direct object *him*.

The English language contains numerous terms derived from French which thusly utilize the French rule for adjective placement with the adjective immediately following the noun-like element that it modifies.

<!-- *adjective.identification_location4 -->
> He was the youngest person ever to serve as attorney *general*.
<!-- .caption -->
The adjective *general* modifies the noun *attorney* despite coming after it.
