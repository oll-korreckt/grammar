## Identification
One popular piece of advice given for identifying adverbs in a sentence is to simply *look for words that end with -ly*. However, such advice implies that adverbs *only* end with -ly which is not at all the case.

In order for a word to be an adverb, it must answer one of the following questions:
- when?
- where?
- why?
- in what manner?
- to what degree?

When it comes to placement within a sentence, adverbs tend to be quite flexible and it is often the case that an adverb could be moved elsewhere in a sentence. In other words, if you can move word around in a sentence, there is a good chance that word is an adverb. For example:

> Bamboo grows *quickly*.
<!-- .gap -->
> Bamboo *quickly* grows.

Yet another example:

> *Tomorrow*, we are eating spaghetti for dinner.
<!-- .gap -->
> We are eating spaghetti for dinner *tomorrow*.

It is important to remember, however, that not all adverbs can be re-positioned within a sentence:

> He looked *around*.
<!-- .caption -->
There is only one possible position for *around* to occupy in this sentence.

### Time
> She is *still* the best.
<!-- .gap -->
> I *just* ate.

### Location
> One can find bamboo *everywhere*.
<!-- .gap -->
> He jumped *vertically*.

### Purpose
> The child was caught stealing from the cookie jar and was punished *consequently*.

### Manner
> The dog *happily* ate her meal.

### Degree
> Her hair is *not* short.
<!-- .gap -->
> Her hair is *quite* short.
