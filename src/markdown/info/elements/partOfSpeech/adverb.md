## Properties

## Identification
One popular piece of advice given for identifying adverbs in a sentence is to simply *look for words that end with -ly*. However, such advice implies that adverbs *only* end with -ly which is not at all the case.

In order for a word to be an adverb, it must answer one of the following questions:
- when?
- where?
- why?
- in what manner?
- to what degree?

When it comes to placement within a sentence, adverbs tend to be quite flexible and it is often the case that an adverb could be moved elsewhere in a sentence. In other words, if you can move word around in a sentence, there is a good chance that word is an adverb. For example:

> Bamboo grows *quickly*.

> Bamboo *quickly* grows.

Yet another example:

<!-- *adverb.identification_front -->
> *Tomorrow*, we are eating spaghetti for dinner.
<!-- .caption -->
*Tomorrow* modifies the verb *are eating*.

<!-- *adverb.identification_end -->
> We are eating spaghetti for dinner *tomorrow*.
<!-- .caption -->
*Tomorrow* still modifies the verb *are eating* in this example.

It is important to remember, however, that not all adverbs can be re-positioned within a sentence:

> He looked *around*.
<!-- .caption -->
There is only one possible position for *around* to occupy in this sentence.

### Time
The adverbs in the following examples answer the question *when*?

> She is *still* the best.

> I *just* ate.

### Location
The adverbs in the following examples answer the question *where*?

> One can find bamboo *everywhere*.

> He jumped *vertically*.

### Purpose
<!-- *adverb.identification_purpose -->
> The child was caught stealing from the cookie jar and was *therefore* punished.
<!-- .caption -->
*Therefore* modifies the verb *was punished* and answers the question *why*?.

### Manner
<!-- *adverb.identification_manner -->
> The dog *happily* ate her meal.
<!-- .caption -->
*Happily* modifies *ate* and answers the question *in what manner*?

### Degree
The adverbs in each example answer the question *to what degree*?

> Her hair is *not* short.

> Her hair is *quite* short.
