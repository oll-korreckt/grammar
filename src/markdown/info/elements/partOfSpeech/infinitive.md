# Infinitives
<!-- +elementInfo -->
<!-- !infinitive -->
An infinitive is the "raw" form of verb without any conjugation. In English, infinitives are marked by the particle "to." Like gerunds, infinitives can be modified by adverbs and can likewise take objects. However, in terms of functionality, infinitives are more flexible than gerunds in that they function as adjectives and adverbs in addition to nouns.

## Functions
As mentioned earlier, infinitives can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb.

### Noun
<!-- *infinitive.noun -->

<!-- .caption -->
*To eat* functions as a noun and is the object of the verb *like*.

### Adjective
<!-- *infinitive.adjective -->
> The Broncos are the team *to beat*.
<!-- .caption -->
*To beat* functions as an adjective and describes the noun *team*.

### Adverb
<!-- *infinitive.adverb -->
> She went to the beach *to swim*.
<!-- .caption -->
*To swim* functions as an adverb and describes the verb *went*.

## Identification
The word *to* is often used to from a [preposition phrases](preposition-phrase). As such, it might be tempting to label an infinitive as preposition phrase. The easiest way to differentiate between the two is to focus on the word associated with *to*:
- If the word is a [noun](noun) or [pronoun](pronoun), the element in question is a preposition phrase.
- If the word is a verb, the element in question is an infinitive.

### Preposition Phrase
<!-- *infinitive.identification_preposition-phrase1 -->
> He gave a present *to **me***.
<!-- .caption -->
**Me** is a pronoun so *to **me*** is a preposition phrase.

<!-- *infinitive.identification_preposition-phrase2 -->
> We flew *to **Rome***.
<!-- .caption -->
**Rome** is a noun so *to **Rome*** is a preposition phrase.

### Infinitive
<!-- *infinitive.identification_infinitive -->
> I need *to **sleep***.
<!-- .caption -->
Here is a tricky example. The word **sleep** can be used as a noun or a verb. Here, however, it is being used as a verb.

### Verbal noun
There are certain words, however, that can be used as the naked form of a verb or as a noun. For example:
- sleep
- laugh
- study
- jump
- love

Here, the key is to focus on how *to* is specifically used as a preposition which is to indicate some sort of transition, transfer, or direction. Also remember, infinitives can be modified using an adverb. Thus, if you could modify the element with an adverb, it is an infinitive.

<!-- *infinitive.verbal-noun_to-sleep -->
> I went *to sleep*.
<!-- .caption -->
Transition. Here, it is a transition of state from being awake to being asleep and so *to sleep* is a preposition phrase.

<!-- *infinitive.verbal-noun_to-love -->
> She devoted her life *to love*.
<!-- .caption -->
Direction. Here, her devotion is being directed toward *love*, and so *to love* is a preposition phrase.

<!-- *infinitive.verbal-noun_to-study -->
> They went to the library *to study*.
<!-- .caption -->
No transition or transfer. They went to library for the purpose of studying so *to study* is an infinitive in this case. You could also theoretically insert an adverb into the sentence in order to modify *to study*. For example: *They went to the library to **diligently** study.*
