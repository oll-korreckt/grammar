Verbs are an essential part of clauses. All clauses must contain a predicate, and thus, a verb. Verbs can take many different forms in order to indicate tense and mood.

## Properties
<!-- +propertySummary -->

### Main Verb
All verbs must contain a main verb property. In order to account for phrasal verbs, the main verb property can reference multiple words so that the main verb and particle can both be referenced by said property.

> I *give up*.
<!-- .caption -->
The main verb property consists of *give* and *up*.

### Auxiliary Verb
Certain English verb tenses and moods require the use of an auxiliary verb. Additionally, English contains modal-auxiliary verbs. The following is a list of English auxiliary verbs:
- be
- can
- will
- do
- have
- must
- need (to/not)
- shall
- should
- may
- ought (to/not)

Certain verb tenses and moods require multiple auxiliary verbs. Thus, the auxiliary verb property can contain multiple words.

> They *have been* waiting for quite some time.
<!-- .caption -->
The auxiliary verbs *have* and *been* are used in combination with *waiting* to form the present perfect continuous verb tense.

## Phrasal Verbs
Certain verbs can be used in combination with a particle or preposition in order to fundamentally alter the semantic meaning of the verb. When a particle is used, it is referenced by the main verb property. When a preposition is used, the verb and the resulting preposition phrase form a verb phrase.
