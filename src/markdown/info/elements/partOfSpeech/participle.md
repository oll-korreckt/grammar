# Participles
<!-- +elementInfo -->
<!-- !participle -->
Participles are derived from verbs. In English, there exists two types of participles: present and past. While often thought of in the context of a certain verb tenses that use participles (such as *progressive* and *perfect* verb tenses), participles can be used separately from verbs in order to function as adjectives and to form [participle phrase](participle-phrase) which likewise function as adjectives.

### Present
Present participles are created by adding a *-ing* to the end of a verb (or, in the case of certain verbs, replacing part of the verb's ending with *-ing*).

### Past
While often derived verbs via a *-ed* or *-d* ending, it is worth noting that there are certain irregular verbs that do not follow this pattern.

## Properties

## Identification
Present and past participles are primarily used as the main verb in *present* and *perfect* verb tenses. Thus, identification can be quite difficult. Since participles and participle phrases function both function as adjectives, participles can be identified by determining whether the participle or the participle phrase could be removed from the clause without destroying the clause or changing the semantic meaning.

### Present Participle
> He is *running*.
<!-- .caption -->
Verb. Here, *running* functions as the main verb of the present continuous tense: *is running*. Removing *running* from the sentence would not destroy the clause, but it would fundamentally alter its semantic meaning.

> The *running* dog is breathing heavily.
<!-- .caption -->
Participle. Here, *running* describes *dog*. You could remove *running* from the sentence and it would not destroy the clause nor the semantic meaning. On the other hand, removing *breathing* would break the sentence since it is the main verb.

### Past Participle

### Passive Perfect
