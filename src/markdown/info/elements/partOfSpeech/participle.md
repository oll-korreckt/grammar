# Participles
<!-- +elementInfo -->
<!-- !participle -->
Participles are derived from verbs. In English, there exists two types of participles: present and past. While often thought of in the context of a certain verb tenses that use participles (such as *progressive* and *perfect* verb tenses), participles can be used separately from verbs in order to function as adjectives and to form [participle phrase](/element/participle-phrase) which likewise function as adjectives.

### Present
Present participles are created by adding a *-ing* to the end of a verb (or, in the case of certain verbs, replacing part of the verb's ending with *-ing*).

### Past
While often derived verbs via a *-ed* or *-d* ending, it is worth noting that there are certain irregular verbs that do not follow this pattern.

## Properties

## Identification
Present and past participles are primarily used as the main verb in *present* and *perfect* verb tenses. Past participles can also mimic [gerunds](/element/gerund) in appearance. Thus, identification can be quite difficult.

### Verb or Participle?
Since participles and participle phrases function both function as adjectives, participles can be identified by determining whether the participle or the participle phrase could be removed from the clause without destroying the clause or changing the semantic meaning.

#### Present Participle
<!-- *participle.identification_present-participle1 -->
> He is *running*.
<!-- .caption -->
Verb. Here, *running* functions as the main verb of the present continuous tense: *is running*. Removing *running* from the sentence would not destroy the clause, but it would fundamentally alter its semantic meaning.

<!-- *participle.identification_present-participle2 -->
> The *running* dog is breathing heavily.
<!-- .caption -->
Participle. Here, *running* describes *dog*. You could remove *running* from the sentence and it would not destroy the clause nor the semantic meaning. On the other hand, removing *breathing* would break the sentence since it is the main verb.

#### Past Participle
<!-- *participle.identification_past-participle1 -->
> She had *defeated* her opponent.
<!-- .caption -->
Verb. Here, *defeated* is the main verb of the past perfect tense: *had defeated*. Removal of *defeated* would not break the clause, but the meaning of the sentence would be changed since it's predicate would be now using a different verb.

<!-- *participle.identification_past-participle2 -->
> Her opponent, badly *defeated*, fled in shame.
<!-- .caption -->
Participle. *Defeated* describes the noun, *opponent*. The participle phrase that it forms, *badly defeated*, could likewise be removed from the sentence.

#### Perfect Participle
<!-- *participle.identification_perfect-participle -->
> *Having* already *eaten*, he decided not to go to the restaurant with his friends.
<!-- .caption -->
*Having* and *eaten* work together to form a perfect participle.

#### Passive Perfect Participle
<!-- *participle.identification_passive-perfect-participle -->
> Her opponent, having been badly beaten, fled in shame.
<!-- .caption -->
*Having been* and *beaten* work together to form a passive perfect participle.

### Gerund or Past Participle?
Gerunds and past participles function differently within sentences: gerunds and [gerund phrases](/element/gerund-phrase) both function as nouns whereas past participles and the participle phrases they form will function only as adjectives.

<!-- *participle.identification_gerund -->
> *Running* for mayor is an arduous task.
<!-- .caption -->
Gerund. *Running* is a gerund and forms the gerund phrase *running for mayor* which functions as the subject of the sentence and is therefore a noun.

<!-- *participle.identification_participle -->
> The *growing* discontent resulted in her election as mayor.
<!-- .caption -->
Participle. *Growing* describes *discontent* and is therefore a participle.
