# Participles
<!-- +elementInfo -->
<!-- !participle -->
Participles are derived from verbs. In English, there exists two types of participles: present and past. While often thought of in the context of a certain verb tenses that use participles (such as *progressive* and *perfect* verb tenses), participles can be used seperate from verbs in order to function as adjectives.

### Present
Present participles are created by adding a *-ing* to the end of a verb (or, in the case of certain verbs, replacing part of the verb's ending with *-ing*).

### Past
While often derived verbs via a *-ed* or *-d* ending, it is worth noting that there are certain irregular verbs that do not follow this pattern.
