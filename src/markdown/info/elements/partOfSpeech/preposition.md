## Identification

### Particle or preposition?
Many words in English can be used as a particle in a phrasal verb or as a preposition. When trying to make a distinction, focus on whether the word in question has an object. If the word has an object, it is a preposition phrase. Otherwise, it is a particle and is part of a verb.

> I gave *up*.
<!-- .caption -->
Particle. *Up* is left by itself and therefore does not take an object.

> I gave *up* my title.
<!-- .caption -->
Still a particle. The phrasal verb *to give up* is both intransitive and transitive. Thus, *up* is still a particle and *my title* is the object of the verb *give up*.

#### Transitive phrasal verbs that use particles
In the previous example, you can tell that *up* is a particle and not a preposition because particles can be split. Thus, the sentence could have been written:

> I gave *my title* up.

As further evidence, transitive phrasal verbs that use particles can only be used in the split form when the object of the verb is a pronoun. Thus, if *my title* were replaced with the pronoun *it*, the sentence could only be written as:

> I gave *it* up.

#### Intransitive phrasal verbs that use preposition phrases
We can apply the previous test to verify that the phrasal verb *to run into* is an intransitive phrasal verb which uses a preposition phrase.

##### With unsplit verb
> I ran into *my teacher* at the supermarket yesterday.

##### With split verb
> I ran *my teacher* into at the supermarket yesterday.

The sentence does not make semantic sense in the second example which indicates that the verb *to run into* is intransitive and that *into* is therefore, a preposition.

#### Intransitive phrasal verbs that use a particle and a preposition phrase
> They got away with the crime.

We know that *away* is a particle because it has no object. *With* is a preposition because it cannot be split. Thus, the following sentence would not make sense semantically:

> They got away the crime with.

### Preposition or adverb?
Likewise, many words in English can be used as a either a preposition or an adverb. As is the case when distinguishing between particles and prepositions, you must look to whether or not the word in question accepts an object.

> They climbed *down* the ladder.
<!-- .caption -->
Preposition. *The ladder* is the object of *down* and the two work in tandem to form the preposition phrase *down the ladder*.

> He looked *down* and saw a four-leaf clover.
<!-- .caption -->
Adverb. *Down* does not have an object and modifies *looked*.
