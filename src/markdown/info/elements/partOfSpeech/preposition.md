## Identification

### Particle or preposition?
Many words in English can be used as a particle in a phrasal verb or as a preposition. When trying to make a distinction, focus on whether the word in question has an object. If the word has an object, it is a preposition phrase. Otherwise, it is a particle and is part of a verb.

> I give *up*.
<!-- .caption -->
Particle. *Up* is left by itself and therefore does not take an object.

> I give *up* my title.
<!-- .caption -->
Preposition. *Up* is used to form the preposition phrase *up my title*.

### Preposition or adverb?
Likewise, many words in English can be used as a either a preposition or an adverb. As is the case when distinguishing between particles and prepositions, you must look to whether or not the word in question accepts an object.

> They climbed *down* the ladder.
<!-- .caption -->
Preposition. *The ladder* is the object of *down* and the two work in tandem to form the preposition phrase *down the ladder*.

> He looked *down* and saw a four-leaf clover.
<!-- .caption -->
Adverb. *Down* does not have an object and modifies *looked*.
