# Pronouns
<!-- +elementInfo -->
<!-- !pronoun -->
Pronouns are words (or sometimes groups of words) that typically reference a [noun](noun). The noun being referenced typically resides somewhere within the same sentence or an adjacent sentence but it depends on the context. However, as is the case with *dummy pronouns*, it is possible for a pronoun not to reference a noun at all.

## Properties

## Functions
Due to the diverse set of responsibilities given to them, pronouns can sometimes be difficult to identify within a sentence.

### Noun


### Interrogative
Certain pronouns (ex: *who*, *whom*, *whose*, *which*, *what*) can be used to create questions. When used in such a manner, they function as a noun.

### Reflexive
When the subject of a clause is also the object of clause's predicate, a reflexive pronoun can be used. Reflexive pronouns are always a single word that contains a -self ending. Examples include: *myself*, *yourself*, *himself*, *herself*, etc.

#### Identification
- Is it just a word that has a -self ending?
- Is the pronoun the object of a verb?
- Is the pronoun's antecedent the subject of the clause?

<!-- *pronoun.reflexive_ex1 -->
> The chef made *himself* a sandwich.
<!-- .caption -->
*Himself* is the indirect object of *made* and references the subject of the sentence, *the chef*.

<!-- *pronoun.reflexive_ex2 -->
> I am glad that you found *yourself* a new job.
<!-- .caption -->
*Yourself* is the indirect object of *found* and references *you* which is the subject of the noun clause *that you found yourself a new job*.

### Intensifier
Intensive pronouns always reference the subject of the sentence and are used to provided increased emphasis on the subject. In spite of referencing a noun, however, intensive pronouns function as [adverbs](adverb) within a sentence, and should therefore be marked as such.

#### Identification
- Is it a single word that ends with -*self*?
- Does the word reference the subject of the sentence?
- Can you remove the word from the sentence without changing the sentence's core meaning?
- Does the word answer the question "in what manner?"

<!-- *pronoun.intensifier_ex1 -->
> Even the king *himself* attended the funeral.
<!-- .caption -->
*Himself* is an adverb that modifies *attended*.

<!-- *pronoun.intensifier_ex2 -->
> I can handle it *myself*.
<!-- .caption -->
*Myself* is an adverb that modifies *handle*.

### Relative
Yet another function of pronouns is to introduce a [relative clause](relative-clause).

<!-- *pronoun.relative_ex1 -->
> She is someone *who* can get stuff done.
<!-- .caption -->
The pronoun *who* introduces the relative clause *who can get stuff done*.

<!-- *pronoun.relative_ex2 -->
> This seems like the kind of car *that* I would want to buy.
<!-- .caption -->
The pronoun *that* introduce the relative clause *that I want to buy*.
