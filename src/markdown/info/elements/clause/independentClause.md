## Properties
<!-- +propertySummary -->

### Subject

#### Implicit subjects
As is the case with all clauses, independent clauses must have a subject. However, unlike other clauses, it is possible to omit the subject of an independent clause as long as the subject is implied.
> Run!
<!-- .caption -->
*Run* is a command being given to an implied subject, *you*.

### Predicate
The predicate of a clause can be either a verb or a verb phrase.

#### Verb
> I *will*.
<!-- .caption -->
*Will* is a verb and acts as the predicate.

#### Verb Phrase
> I *will not*.
<!-- .caption -->
The adverb *not* modifies the verb *will*. Together, they form the verb phrase *will not* which serves as the predicate of the clause.
